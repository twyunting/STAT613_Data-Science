1.2.5a:  - 0.25 Should not be any colors or legend

1.2.6a:  - 0.2 Should use loess smoother
1.2.6b:  - 0.15 Incorrect interpretation. Even the line shows a positive correlation 
1.2.6c:  - 0.2 Should use loess smoother
1.2.6d:  - 0.15 Incorrect interpretation. Even the line shows a negative correlation and a curve would show more 
1.2.7a:  - 0.25 Did not use abline
1.2.7b:  - 0.1 Limited interpretation due to missing abline
1.2.8a:  - 0.75 Incorrect sort and rank order dense_rank gives a misleading ranks as there are no gaps in the numbers. So if 2000 universities are tied in ROI and one university is below it is rank 2, not 2001
1.2.8b:  - 0.1 Showed 6 , not 5
1.2.8c:  - 0 You should notice this does not look right given the plot below

1.3.4c:  - 0.2 Incorrect title for Population legend 
1.3.4d:  - 0.1 Incomplete - should also discuss fertility rate
