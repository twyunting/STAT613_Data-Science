HW 03 Graded 
To all,
Comments and scores for HW 03 are posted. Most everyone did will with most deductions for minor errors. Offer the following general comments to help with follow on homework and courses. 

From a philosophical perspective, this course is not just about learning R but learning how to do "data science." You need to do more than just figure out how to get something to work one time. Your work should be reproducible, transparent, and as straightforward as possible using the tools from 412/612 and this course. The only time I expect to see base R plots is for checking residuals as part of EDA. 

1. Read the instructions carefully to include using the starter file, changing the name of the file and putting your name in the YAML header author field, and submitting an HTML file that is current. Submitting improperly formatted documents will reduce your score. If the instructions say to pipe to another function like a plot, then don't create intermediate variables that are not necessary or you will lose points. If they say to interpret a plot then do so. I can't give any partial credit for missing answers.The point deductions will increase each week for failure to follow the basic instructions. In the outside world, failure to follow instructions or specifications leads to unaccepted work which costs time and wastes resources.

2. Never set the working directory inside your .Rmd File (or .R file). Never use absolute paths, especially when the question says use a relative path. Point deductions will increase for these errors each week,

3. Check your HTM file for extraneous output. It is fine when running interactively if you to check your data, But in an HTML file that can generate pages and pages and pages, ... of meaningless output for which I will reduce your score. Remove or comment out the offending lines. Point deductions will increase for these errors each week,

4. Error checking should be complete for length, type, and any restrictions on values. Remember `"cat">0` is TRUE. Create meaningful error messages if using stop() not just "error". Test your error checking with bad values until you have covered the mostly likely errors

5. Use vector to initialize output vectors for loops. I did not take points off for using seq(1:1000) but I did for just saying `list()` without a length as that generates a list that has one value and you force R to request new memory every time you iterate the loop

6. If someone gives you example test cases and answers try your work against them before the question values. If your functions fails the examples there is something wrong.

7. Finally, the extra credit problem said test against a Uniform distribution using a qqplot. Using a Normal distribution QQ plot will not work. It will show the sample has symmetrically heavy tails and is Not normal. 

As always, if you see any errors in the grading or have any questions please let me know.
